# ðŸ”§ Firebase & Contract Deletion Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Firebase User Deletion Error
**Problem**: When deleting users in admin-dashboard.html, users were being deleted from users.json but not from Firebase database.

**Root Cause**: Firebase Admin SDK was not properly configured, causing the error "Firebase Admin SDK not configured. User deletion limited to local data cleanup."

**Solution**: 
- Updated `api/firebase.js` to provide better error handling and instructions
- Added clear logging to help identify configuration issues
- Improved error messages to guide proper Firebase setup

**To Enable Firebase User Deletion**:
1. Set the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` environment variable with your Firebase service account JSON
2. Or set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to point to your service account file
3. Restart the server

### 2. Contract Deletion - PDF File Removal
**Problem**: When deleting contracts from admin-dashboard.html, contracts were removed from uploaded-contracts.json but PDF files weren't deleted from the /contracts folder.

**Root Cause**: GitHub API deletion was failing silently, and no local file cleanup was implemented.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced contract deletion logic in `admin-dashboard.html` with multiple fallback mechanisms
- Added local file deletion API endpoint `/api/contracts/delete-local`
- Implemented three-tier deletion strategy:
  1. Try GitHub deletion first
  2. Fallback to local file deletion if GitHub fails
  3. Final fallback to local deletion for any remaining files

**New Features**:
- Local PDF file cleanup when GitHub deletion fails
- Better error reporting and logging
- Improved success messages showing deletion counts

### 3. User Data Syncing in User Portal
**Problem**: Users logging in through Firebase weren't properly loading their job data from users.json.

**Root Cause**: User matching logic wasn't robust enough to handle case sensitivity and null email values.

**Solution**:
- Improved `checkUserInSystem()` function with better logging
- Enhanced `loadUsersData()` function with detailed console output
- Added case-insensitive email matching
- Better error reporting to help debug user matching issues

## API Endpoints Added

### `/api/contracts/delete-local`
- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Delete PDF files from local contracts folder
- **Body**: `{ "fileName": "filename.pdf" }`
- **Response**: Success/failure status with message

## Environment Variables Required

### For Firebase User Deletion:
```env
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT={"type":"service_account","project_id":"cochran-films",...}
# OR
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service-account.json
```

### For GitHub Contract Deletion:
```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token_here
GITHUB_OWNER=cochranfilms
GITHUB_REPO=cochran-job-listings
GITHUB_BRANCH=main
```

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Firebase User Deletion:
1. Go to admin-dashboard.html
2. Try to delete a user
3. Check console for detailed error messages
4. If Firebase is not configured, user will be removed from users.json only

### Test Contract Deletion:
1. Go to admin-dashboard.html
2. Select contracts to delete
3. Check console for deletion progress
4. Verify PDF files are removed from /contracts folder

### Test User Portal Data Loading:
1. Log in to user-portal.html with Firebase
2. Check console for user matching logs
3. Verify job data loads correctly from users.json

## Manual Push Commands

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit the fixes
git commit -m "Fix Firebase user deletion and contract PDF cleanup

- Improve Firebase Admin SDK error handling and instructions
- Add local PDF file deletion API endpoint
- Enhance contract deletion with multiple fallback mechanisms
- Improve user data syncing in user portal
- Add better logging and error reporting"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Firebase Service Account**: Set up proper Firebase Admin SDK credentials
2. **Test All Deletion Scenarios**: Verify both user and contract deletions work properly
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check console output for any remaining issues
4. **Update Documentation**: Update README.md with new environment variable requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Firebase Issues:
- Check if `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` environment variable is set
- Verify the service account JSON has proper permissions
- Check console logs for detailed error messages

### Contract Deletion Issues:
- Verify GitHub token has repository write permissions
- Check if PDF files exist in /contracts folder
- Review console logs for deletion progress

### User Portal Issues:
- Check if user email matches exactly in users.json
- Verify users.json is properly formatted
- Review console logs for user matching details
