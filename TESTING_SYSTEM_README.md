## Test Data

The system uses test data that is automatically cleaned up:

- **Test User**: `test@cochranfilms.com`
- **Test Job**: "Test Photography Job"
- **Test Contract**: "test-delete-pdf.pdf" (creates actual PDF file)
- **Test Notification**: "Test Notification"

All test data is removed after tests complete to avoid cluttering your system.

### PDF Deletion Test Process
1. **Creates Test PDF**: Uses GitHub API to create `test-delete-pdf.pdf` in `/contracts` folder
2. **Adds Contract Record**: Updates `uploaded-contracts.json` with test contract data
3. **Tests Deletion APIs**: Tests both `/api/delete-pdf` and GitHub file deletion
4. **Cleanup**: Removes test PDF file and contract records after testing

## Vercel Deployment

### **Live Server Testing**
The automated testing system is fully compatible with Vercel serverless deployment:

- **Dashboard URL**: `https://collaborate.cochranfilms.com/test-dashboard.html`
- **API Endpoints**: All `/api/*` endpoints work on live server
- **Test Runner**: Uses Vercel-compatible `test-runner-vercel.js`
- **File Operations**: Handles serverless file system operations
- **CORS**: Configured for cross-origin requests

### **Deployment Process**
1. **Push to GitHub**: All changes automatically deploy to Vercel
2. **API Functions**: Serverless functions handle test execution
3. **File Storage**: JSON files and test results stored in Vercel environment
4. **Cleanup**: Automatic test data cleanup after each run

## Integration with Workflow

### Before Deployments

```

### Continuous Monitoring
Set up automated testing to run periodically:
```bash
# Add to cron job or CI/CD pipeline
0 */6 * * * cd /path/to/project && node run-tests.js
```

### Development Workflow
1. Make changes to your code
2. Run tests: `node run-tests.js`
3. Fix any issues identified
4. Re-run tests to verify fixes
5. Deploy when all tests pass

## Customization

### Adding New Tests

1. Open `test-runner.js`
2. Add new test method following the pattern:
   ```javascript
   async testNewFeature() {
       const startTime = Date.now();
       
       try {
           // Your test logic here
           const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
           
           return {
               success: true,
               message: 'Test completed successfully',
               details: { /* test details */ },
               duration
           };
       } catch (error) {
           return {
               success: false,
               message: 'Test failed',
               details: { error: error.message }
           };
       }
   }
   ```

3. Add the test to `runAllTests()` method
