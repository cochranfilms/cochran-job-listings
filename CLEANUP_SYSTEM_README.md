# 🧹 Test Data Cleanup System

## Overview

The automated testing system includes a comprehensive cleanup mechanism that tracks all test data created during testing and provides commands to remove it completely. This ensures your system remains clean and production-ready.

## How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Test Data Logging**

Every test that creates data automatically logs it for cleanup:

```javascript
// Example: When a test user is created
this.logTestData('USER_CREATED', {
    email: 'test@cochranfilms.com',
    timestamp: '2025-08-05T19:57:43.322Z',
    file: 'users.json'
});
```

### 2. **Comprehensive Tracking**

The system tracks all test data across:

- **Users**: `test@cochranfilms.com`
- **Jobs**: "Test Photography Job"
- **Contracts**: "test-contract.pdf", "test-delete-pdf.pdf"
- **Performance Reviews**: Reviews for test users
- **Notifications**: "Test Notification"
- **Files**: PDF files in `/contracts/` directory

### 3. **Log File Generation**

Each test run creates a log file: `test-data-log-YYYY-MM-DD.json`

Example log structure:
```json
[
  {
    "action": "USER_CREATED",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-05T19:57:43.322Z",
    "data": {
      "email": "test@cochranfilms.com",
      "file": "users.json"
    }
  },
  {
    "action": "CONTRACT_CREATED",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-05T19:57:43.327Z",
    "data": {
      "fileName": "test-contract.pdf",
      "contractId": "TEST-001",
      "file": "uploaded-contracts.json"
    }
  }
]
```

## Cleanup Commands

### **Option 1: Cleanup After Tests**
```bash
# Run tests and automatically clean up
node run-tests.js --cleanup
```

### **Option 2: Cleanup Only**
```bash
# Only clean up existing test data (don't run tests)
node run-tests.js --cleanup-only
```

### **Option 3: Manual Cleanup**
```bash
# Clean up specific test data manually
node -e "
const testRunner = require('./test-runner');
const runner = new testRunner();
runner.cleanupTestData().then(() => console.log('✅ Cleanup completed'));
"
```

## What Gets Cleaned Up

### **Users (`users.json`)**
- Removes test user: `test@cochranfilms.com`
- Updates total user count
- Updates last modified timestamp

### **Jobs (`jobs-data.json`)**
- Removes test job: "Test Photography Job"
- Updates total job count
- Updates last modified timestamp



### **Notifications (`notifications.json`)**
- Removes test notification: "Test Notification"
- Updates total notification count

### **PDF Files (`/contracts/` directory)**
- Removes test PDF files: "test-contract.pdf", "test-delete-pdf.pdf"
- Cleans up any test PDF files created during testing
- Maintains production PDF files (CF-*.pdf files)

### **PDF Generation System**
- **Library Integration**: jsPDF and html2canvas libraries properly integrated
- **On-the-fly Generation**: PDFs generated from contract data when files don't exist
- **Fallback System**: Multiple download methods ensure successful file access
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Professional Design**: Consistent PDF styling across all interfaces

### **PDF Files (`/contracts/` directory)**
- Removes test PDF files: "test-contract.pdf", "test-delete-pdf.pdf"
- Cleans up any test contract files created during testing
- Maintains production PDF files (CF-*.pdf files)

### **Code Quality Issues**

- **Timing Fixes**: Added retry mechanism for DOM elements that may not be ready immediately
- **Notification System**: Added complete UI notification system with bell icon, dropdown, and real-time functionality
- **Duplicate Fix**: Removed duplicate `notifications` variable declaration to resolve linter error
- **Syntax Fix**: Added missing `try` blocks to notification functions to resolve JavaScript syntax errors
- **Popup Notification Cleanup**: Removed hardcoded popup notifications for automatic job status changes, replaced with console logs
- **Design Quality Enhancement**: Upgraded spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy to achieve professional "next level touch" design standards
- **Login Screen Enhancement**: Implemented glassy, floating 3D design with sophisticated backdrop-filter blur effects, enhanced animations, and professional micro-interactions
- **Performance Data Migration**: Migrated performance data from performance-data.js to centralized users.json system, eliminating data fragmentation
- **Admin Dashboard Integration**: Updated admin dashboard to save performance data directly to centralized users.json system instead of separate performance.json files
- Updates unread count
- Updates last modified timestamp

### **Files (`/contracts/` directory)**
- Removes test PDF files from contracts directory
- Handles missing files gracefully
- **PDF Download API**: Ensures the PDF download API endpoint is properly configured
- **Download Functions**: Verifies download functions in admin dashboard and user portal are working

## Cleanup Process

### **Step 1: Data Collection**
The system reads the test data log and categorizes items for cleanup:

```javascript
const cleanupData = {
    users: ['test@cochranfilms.com'],
    jobs: ['Test Photography Job'],

    notifications: ['Test Notification'],
    files: ['test-contract.pdf', 'test-delete-pdf.pdf']
};
```

### **Step 2: Systematic Removal**
For each category, the system:

1. **Fetches current data** from the appropriate JSON file
2. **Removes test items** based on the log
3. **Updates counters** and timestamps
4. **Saves the cleaned data** back to the file
5. **Removes physical files** from the file system

### **Step 3: Verification**
- Logs the number of items removed
- Clears the test data log file
- Reports success or failure

## Test Data Lifecycle

### **During Testing**
```
1. Test creates user → Logged as USER_CREATED
2. Test creates job → Logged as JOB_CREATED
3. Test creates notification → Logged as NOTIFICATION_CREATED
```

### **During Cleanup**
```
1. Read test data log
2. Remove users from users.json
3. Remove jobs from jobs-data.json
4. Remove notifications from notifications.json
7. Delete physical files from /contracts/
8. Clear test data log
```

## Safety Features

### **Idempotent Operations**
- Cleanup can be run multiple times safely
- Missing items are handled gracefully
- No errors if test data doesn't exist

### **Data Integrity**
- Only removes items that were logged as test data
- Preserves all production data
- Updates file timestamps and counters correctly

### **Error Handling**
- Continues cleanup even if individual items fail
- Logs errors without stopping the process
- Reports final cleanup status

## Monitoring Cleanup

### **Log Output**
```
🧹 Starting test data cleanup...
✅ Cleanup completed: 8 items removed
```

### **Log File**
The system creates a detailed log of what was cleaned up:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-05T19:57:48.741Z",
  "action": "CLEANUP_COMPLETED",
  "details": {
    "usersRemoved": 1,
    "jobsRemoved": 1,
    "contractsRemoved": 2,
    "performanceRemoved": 1,
    "notificationsRemoved": 1,
    "filesRemoved": 2,
    "totalRemoved": 8
  }
}
```

## Integration with Workflow

### **Development Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Make changes to your code
# 2. Run tests with cleanup
node run-tests.js --cleanup

# 3. Verify system is clean
# 4. Deploy to production
```

### **Continuous Integration**
```bash
# Add to CI/CD pipeline
node run-tests.js --cleanup
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Tests passed and cleanup completed"
    # Continue with deployment
else
    echo "❌ Tests failed or cleanup failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

### **Manual Cleanup**
```bash
# If you need to clean up manually
node run-tests.js --cleanup-only
```

## Troubleshooting

### **Cleanup Not Working**
1. Check if test data log exists: `ls test-data-log-*.json`
2. Verify log file content: `cat test-data-log-2025-08-05.json`
3. Run cleanup with verbose output
4. Check file permissions

### **Partial Cleanup**
- Run cleanup multiple times
- Check for file system errors
- Verify JSON file integrity

### **Missing Log File**
- Run tests first to generate log
- Check for write permissions
- Verify disk space

## Best Practices

### **Before Production**
1. Always run tests with cleanup: `node run-tests.js --cleanup`
2. Verify no test data remains
3. Check all JSON files are clean
4. Confirm file system is clean

### **Regular Maintenance**
1. Run cleanup weekly: `node run-tests.js --cleanup-only`
2. Monitor log file sizes
3. Archive old test result files
4. Verify system integrity

### **Emergency Cleanup**
```bash
# If you need to clean up everything manually
rm -f test-data-log-*.json
rm -f test-results-*.json
# Then run the cleanup system
node run-tests.js --cleanup-only
```
