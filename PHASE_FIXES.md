# Phase Fixes Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks the fixes for various issues in the Cochran Films landing page system.

## Phase 1 Fix - Error User Not Found Alert
**Issue**: Error alert shows up in user-portal.html as soon as the page loads, even before user login attempts. Continues to show after successful login and page reload.

**Root Cause**: The `checkUserInSystem()` function is being called immediately when Firebase auth state changes, even when no user is properly authenticated.

**Fix**: Modify the authentication flow to only check user in system after proper authentication and prevent premature error alerts.

## Phase 2 Fix - Undefined Job Status
**Issue**: When users log into user-portal.html, their job status shows "undefined" despite jobs being properly defined in users.json.

**Root Cause**: The job display logic is not properly accessing the job data structure from users.json.

**Fix**: Update the job display logic to correctly access and display job information from the users.json structure.

## Phase 3 Fix - Performance Review Popup Persistence
**Issue**: Performance review orange popup in admin-dashboard.html stays up too long. Should disappear immediately when admin clicks "write review".

**Root Cause**: The popup dismissal logic is not properly implemented when the review modal is opened.

**Fix**: Add immediate popup dismissal when the performance review modal is opened.

## Phase 4 Fix - Notification Menu Z-Index
**Issue**: Notification menu in admin-dashboard.html falls behind content. Should come to forefront when clicked. Clicking notifications should navigate to relevant screens and only dismiss upon completion.

**Root Cause**: Z-index issues and missing navigation logic for notifications.

**Fix**: Update CSS z-index and implement proper notification click handlers with navigation logic.

## Phase 5 Fix - Take Action Button Logic
**Issue**: In user-portal.html "Your Current Jobs" section, "Take Action" button is always present even when user is waiting on admin (no action needed).

**Root Cause**: The action button logic doesn't differentiate between user actions and admin actions.

**Fix**: Implement conditional logic to only show "Take Action" when user actually needs to take action.

## Phase 6 Fix - Status Manager in Performance Review
**Issue**: Status manager in performance review editor may be unnecessary unless linked to performance.json.

**Root Cause**: Status dropdown exists but may not be properly integrated with the performance review data structure.

**Fix**: Verify status manager integration with performance.json and remove if unnecessary.

## Phase 7 Fix - Save Review Function Error
**Issue**: When admin clicks 'save review' in admin-dashboard.html, nothing happens due to missing `updatePerformanceReviewsOnGitHub` function.

**Error**: `admin-dashboard:3670 Uncaught ReferenceError: updatePerformanceReviewsOnGitHub is not defined`

**Root Cause**: The function `updatePerformanceReviewsOnGitHub` is referenced but not defined.

**Fix**: Implement the missing `updatePerformanceReviewsOnGitHub` function or replace with proper save logic.
